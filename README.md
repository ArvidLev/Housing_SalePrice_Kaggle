# Housing_SalePrice_Kaggle
For this project I estimated SalePrice of houses using methods from tidymodels such as rsampel, recipe, workflow, parsnip, tune and yardstick.
* Cleaned and preproccesed data by imputing, dummy variables, remove near zero variance columns.
* Used Lasso, MARS and RandomForest which I tuned using 5-fold crossvalidation
* Selected the best model using RMSE
